This is a program that sets out to build a fake representation of the stock market. 

The end goal is to have a functioning market system that can accept buy and sell orders with stock price changes impacted by supply and demand using bid/asks

In order to build, navigate to the /build directory in your terminal and enter "cmake ../". This will create a makefile in the build directory 
called main_run. Then just enter ./main_run.
